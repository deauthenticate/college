**Files for College Work**

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide learners with ready-to-use code examples that can be used as a reference while solving DSA academic questions or practicing coding exercises. These samples are designed to demonstrate the implementation of common algorithms and data structures frequently encountered in academic settings.

## Note

 To execute the code successfully, it is essential to copy-paste individual code snippets into a separate file or IDE. Running the entire file together may result in syntax errors due to the mixing of multiple code samples in the same file.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have solved DSA academic questions and want to share your code samples or have any improvements to the existing code, feel free to submit a pull request.
